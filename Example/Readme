To run a nginx+uwsgi+flask web server, just run command:
#nginx
#uwsgi test.ini
or
#uwsgi runserver.ini
Be sure of your Flask project was correct configured as the requires in this document.


Then you can visit http://server-machine-ip:80/test
Note that you need to map a host port to container's 80 port


To specify nginx http port, just edit /etc/nginx/nginx.conf Line 12
default port is modified to 80

If you want run with your own Flask project, just using 
sudo docker -v yourFlaskPrjPath:~/webroot
and make sure that your entry py file is named to ‚Äùmain.py"
and the app object is named to "app"

# uwsgi socket ip
socket = 127.0.0.1:3031
# Your Flask app location
chdir=./WebApp/
# Your Flask app filename
wsgi-file=Example.py
# Your Flask app Object name (such as "app = Flask(__name__)")
callable=app


sudo docker run -it -v /yourWebAppPath:/root/webroot -P --name=webtest joe8767/webserver 

sudo docker run -it -v /home/joe/Docker/ContainerBuild/Build-Try-4/webroot:/root/webroot -P --name=webtest1 joe8767/webserver
